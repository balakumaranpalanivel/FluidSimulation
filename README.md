# Fluid Simulation

This project implements a simple SPH Fluid Simulation technique.

## Features

* Multiple forces affecting on the particle
* Inter-Particle collision and Particle-Plane (Bounding Box) collision implemented
* Forward Euler method used to compute the effect of forces in each time step
* Capable of simulating over 10000 particles.
* Color of the fluid particles are changed over time with respect to its density to simulate the effect of flowing water
